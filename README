// Integrating your Personality Forge chatbot with Discord
// Courtesy of Zeig Wolf


////// Using this code --- The node modules are already included for you

// 1) Install VSCode -- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
// 2) Install node.js -- https://nodejs.org/en/download/
// 3) Set up your application in the discord developer portal to create your bot -- https://discord.com/developers/applications
// 4) Once your bot is created, go to "Applications", select your bot, "Bot", and under "Privileged Gateway Intents", tick "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" and "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT"
// 5) Keep the portal open, we will return to it later
// 6) Open VSCode, drag the "Personality Forge Discord Bot" folder into VSCode to sync it
// 8) In the discord developer portal, under "Bot", "Build-A-Bot", click copy to get your Token. Paste this in your .env file after "TOKEN = "
// 9) In The Personality Forge, under Intigrate, Chatbot API, copy your API Key. Paste this in your .env file after "apiKey = "
//10) In The Personality Forge, under Intigrate, Chatbot API, copy your bot ID. Paste this in your .env file after "botID = "
//11) NEVER SHARE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR .env FILE, these are the literal keys to your application, you don't want someone else behind the wheel. Reset them if they ever leak
//12) You're done! In the VSCode menu bar, click Terminal, New Terminal, type "node index.js" in the terminal to run your bot, use Ctrl+c to stop running your bot
//13) These files can be hosted to run 24/7, but that's up to you

////// Inviting your bot to your discord server //////
// 1) In the discord developer portal, under OAuth2, URL Generator. Under "SCOPES", tick "bot". Under BOT PERMISSIONS, tick "Read Messages/View Channels" and "Send Messages" 
// 2) Copy the GENERATED URL at the bottom, paste and search in a browser
